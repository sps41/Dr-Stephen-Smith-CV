# Personal Activities

I am a keen waterpolo player, having competed at all levels up to national. I have also been a referee at National standard and am a level 3 waterpolo coach. I have previoulsy held positions on the national governing board for UK national waterpolo. I still play, though less than I would like, and love the experience of being part of a competetive team. My current club is the City of Cambridge Waterpolo Club, and I have previously played for the Universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh, Scottish Universities, Warrender Waterpolo Club, royal Tunbridge Wells Monsoon and Beckenham Swimming club. <br>
I am an ex-competetive national-standard swimmer, having competed at middle and long distance front crawl. I still like swimming, but only for pleasure these days. I play squash, though not as well as I'd like and am a keen if not elegant skier. <br>
With my family I enjoy cooking, perticularly what we can grow ourselves, skiing and supporting my wife on the hockey pitch.
