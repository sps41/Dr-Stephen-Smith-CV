**Training Plan for Loch Lomond**

Starting November 2020, swim at end of August 2021 (9 months)<br>
*Aim:* Swim 4.5km/h for up to 12 hours in 14 degree water.<br>

**Objectives:**<br>
*Speed* - need to be able to get to 4.5 kph (1:20/100m) at HR 150 and maintain that.<br>
*Endurance* - need to swim at HR 150 for up to 12 hours<br>
*Cold tolerance* - water is likely to be 14-16 degrees, so need to be able to tolerate 14 degrees indefinitely while swimming<br>
*Technical* - Swim alongside a boat and sight from it, swim in darkness, swim with regular feeds<br>

**Speed**

*Aim:* Increase stroke length to at least 1.17m (SPL of 17 or less consistently)<br>
*Aim:* Increase SR to 64/min at HR 150.<br>

*Why?* In order to swim at 4.5 kph I need to maintain a stroke rate and stroke length that equal or exceed 1.25 m/sec. Ideally need to lengthen stroke rather than raise strooke rate too far.<br>
At the moment my comfortable stroke rate is about 54/min (1.11 secs/stroke, 0.9 strokes/sec) and my stroke length is about 1.05m (19 SPL, 58% efficiency). <br>
That combination gives a speed of 0.945 m/sec (pace: 1:45/100m). at that speed I'd finish in 11h45m ish.<br>
Increasing my stroke rate but maintaining length would need a SR of 72/min to achieve the right pace.<br>
If I could lengthen my stroke to a 65% efficiency (1.8*0.65=1.17m, == 17SPL) I would need a SR of 64/min (0.936 sec/stroke).<br>

*How?* Technique, strength and power all need to improve.<br>
*Strength:* 3 weights sessions /wk over the winter as Hips&legs/Back/Chest&shoulders. 10 mins each, slow and deliberate movements gradually increasing the reps<br>
*Power:* From May start more explosive movements with the kettlebell, still targeting the same muscle groups but aiming for more sustained movement.<br>
*Technique*: 1 pool or OW session dedicated to technical improvements. The main areas to target are breathing, catch shape, high hips and kick.<br>
*Kick:* I need to develop a reasonable 4-beat kick and be able to maintain in<br>
*Hips*: Targeting the kick will help, but need to keep working on hip shape all the time<br>
*Catch:* Neuromuscular development by doing drills and focusing hard on the catch shape<br>
*Breathing:* I will work on this every swim!<br>

**Endurance**

*Aim:* increase total range at 150 bpm to 10 hours by end of May<br>

*Why?* I need to maintain my SR at 150 for that long to make the distance<br>
*How?* Gradually increase the time spent on long swims over the winter season, aiming for a full 10 hour swim at the end of May. Currently longest swim is 3 hours, so start there. These can be done in wetsuit and pace doesn't matter - just keeping HR at around 150bpm.<br>
Nov: 3h, 3.5h, 4h<br>
Dec: 4h, 4.5h, 5h<br>
Jan: 5h, 5.5h, 6h<br>
Feb: 6h, 6.5h, 7h<br>
Mar: 7h, 7.5h 8h<br>
Apr: 8h, 8.5h, 9h<br>
May: 9h, 9.5h 10h<br>

**Cold tolerance**

*Aim:* Swim for 10 hours at 14 degrees

*How:* Polar Bear challenge over winter, and then make the long swims skins at the right temps during the summer.

**Boat sighting**

*Aim:* 3 swims alongside a boat at appropriate speed

**Darkness:**

*Aim:* 4 swims in total darkness (3 hours+)

**Nutrition**

*Aim:* Establish a feeding pattern on long (>3h) swims which is comfortable.

**Plan:** <br>
*Winter (Nov-Mar):* 3 swims as technical, cold, long + 3 strength sets + flexibility/recovery<br>
*Spring (Mar-May):* 4 swims as technical, threshold, cold/long, long + 3 strength/Power sets + flexibility/recovery<br>
*Summer (June-Aug):* Race prep. 4 swims, thresholdx2, longx1, race prepx1 (boat sighting/feeding/dark) +2 power sets +recovery <br>
