# Research Work and Interests

## Current Research 

**Computational analysis of next-generation sequencing data in squamous cell oncogenesis.**<br>
**Sponsor:** [Professor Nicholas Coleman](https://www.path.cam.ac.uk/directory/nick-coleman) <br>
**Collaborators:** [Professor Eugene Healy (Univ. Southampton)](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/medicine/about/staff/ehealy.page), Prof. Chris Smith (Cambridge, Biochemistry) & [Dr. Anton Enright (Univ. Cambridge/EMBL-EBI)](https://www.path.cam.ac.uk/directory/anton-enright)<br>

Squamous cell carcinogenesis is a complex, highly integrated systems-based process. In order to more fully understand the nature of genomic processes underlying the transformation from epithelium to SCC I am interrogating large scale NGS datasets (both RNA-seq and DNA-seq). This MRC funded post-doctoral fellowship is focused on the analysis and integration of expression profiling and genomic sequencing data, including network analysis and comparative analysis of publically available data (such as from TCGA) with our experimental work. The project is particularly trageted at understanding the role of alternative RNA splicing in the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma. We will use patient-derived samples from skin and cervix and aim to translate the findings across squamous-type carcinomas in other organ systems.

**Understanding transcriptional events in melanoma carcinogenesis for early diagnosis, prognosis and novel therapeutic approaches.**<br>  

Leveraging extensive and detailed publically available data collections of next-generation sequencing and microarray analyses of melanoma samples I have applied machine learning and network biology analyses to understand the early events that transition primary melanoma to metastatic disease. In order to further understand how molecular events drive melanoma initiation and progression I am leading a project targeting co-dependent pathways in order to identify genes showing genetic dosage lethality in melanoma. The project aims to translate these findings into potential avenues for therapy using repositioned existing drug treatments.

**Drug design and repositioning**<br>

The development of new therapies is costly and time-consuming. There exists an enormous library of therapeutic compounds whose activity can be predicted to extend across multiple diseases, but which are not used in such a way. By analysing transcriptomic and genetic data from diseases of interest (atopic dermatitis, skin cancer, cervical cancer etc) we aim to identify promising compunds with established pharmacological profiles to test in novel therapeutic areas, shortening the time from discovery to prescription.

**Non-invasive Diagnostics in Skin Disease**<br>

The gold standard non-invasive diagnostic tool for skin cancer by dermatologists is the dermatoscope. Presently dermatoscopes are expensive and affordable models lack digital capabilities. These factors make their use outside specilist centres in wealthy countries infeasible. I am directing a project aiming to produce and refine a low-cost, simple digital dermatoscope for widespread use in clinical contexts where cost sensitivity curently limits their deployment. Additional imaging capabilities will also be integrated to the device to enable it to perform as a cutting-edge research tool in the optical investigation of skin biology. Future work will be focused on leveraging this tool as a platform for computationally aided diagnostics with important potential applications in resource-limited settings. This work has been supported by a grant from the University of Cambridge Biomaker Challenge and has won 2nd prize at the Cambridge Judge Business School's medical technologies competition (2019). I am the founder and co-director of Deepskin Dermatology, a company founded to commercialise and exploit this technology
