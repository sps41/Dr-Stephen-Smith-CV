# Research Work and Interests

## Current Research 

**Computational analysis of next-generation sequencing data in squamous cell oncogenesis.**  
**Sponsor:** Professor Nicholas Coleman  
Squamous cell carcinogenesis is a complex, highly integrated systems-based process. In order to more fully understand the naturew of genomic processes underlying the transformation from epithelium to SCC we have interrogated large scale NGS datasets (both RNA-seq and DNA-seq). My primary role is the analysis and integration of expression profiling and genomic sequencing data, including network analysis and integrating publically available data (such as from TCGA) with our experimental work.

**Early events in melanoma carcinogenesis targeting early diagnosis/prognosis.**  
Leveraging extensive and detailed publically available data collections of next-generation sequencing and microarray analyses of melanoma samples I have applied machine learning and network biology analyses to understand the early events that transition primary melanoma to metastatic disease. Verification work and molecular characterisation is underway. The initial work has been presented nationally.

## Masters Thesis 

**Functional genomics analysis of papillomavirus oncogenesis in W12 cell lines**  
**Supervisor:** Professor Nicholas Coleman  
This research explored the functional genomic aspects of HPV carcinogenesis applying network models to high-quality gene expression data in a cell model of HPV16 mediated oncogenesis. This work has been submitted for publication.

## PhD Thesis 

**Evidence for a remote lung response in endotoxin-mediated direct lung injury: a strategic application of microarray technology.**    
**Supervisors:** Dr David Collie & Dr Varrie Ogilvie  
Construction and assay of a suppression-subtraction-hybridisation ovine lung sequence library followed by molecular genomic probing of sheep lung tissue from in vivo models of acute lung injury via novel microarray and qRT-PCR to characterise inflammatory responses in lung segments.

## BSc Honours Thesis
